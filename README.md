# flutter_namer

This was my first foray into Flutter and Dart. This project was developed along with [Flutter's first app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#8) tutorial.

## Steps to run Flutter Namer locally:
- Clone the repo into a new directory
- Select your preferred device 
- Run > Start Debugging OR click the Start Debugging icon 
- Enjoy!
